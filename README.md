This repository contains the analysis and figures for "Benefits of Fast Battery Formation in a Model System", by Peter M. Attia et al., available at [this DOI](https://doi.org/10.1149/1945-7111/abff35).

Each dataset is analyzed in a corresponding Jupyter notebook.
All figures are saved into the `\figures` directory.
The schematics were created in [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) (note that the schematics were not used in the final version of the paper).
